# Task Completion Checklist

## When a coding task is completed:

### 1. Build and Type Checking
- Run `npm run build` to ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Fix any type errors that appear during build

### 2. Development Testing
- Run `npm run dev` to test the component in development mode
- Verify the component renders correctly
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Test interactive elements (buttons, hover states, etc.)

### 3. Code Quality
- Ensure proper TypeScript types are defined
- Verify all props have proper interfaces
- Check that component follows established naming conventions
- Ensure Tailwind classes are used appropriately

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Verify no unnecessary re-renders
- Check that API calls are properly handled
- Ensure loading states are implemented where needed

### 5. Accessibility
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify proper ARIA labels where needed
- Check color contrast meets accessibility standards

## No Formal Linting/Testing Setup
The project currently doesn't have ESLint, Prettier, or formal testing frameworks configured. Manual code review and browser testing are the primary quality assurance methods.
